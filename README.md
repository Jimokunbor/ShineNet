# Shine Net

**A Daily-Utility Web & Mobile Application**

## Project Overview
Shine Net aims to provide users with essential daily utilities (e.g., expense tracking, to-do reminders, local deals) in one unified platform—accessible via both web and mobile interfaces.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Backend:** Django (Python) or Node.js + Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend (Web):** React
- **Mobile:** Flutter (Dart) or React Native (JavaScript)
- **Containerization/Deployment:** Docker (on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)

## Repository Structure (initial)
- `README.md` – project overview (this file)
- `backend/` – backend service code (to be created)
- `frontend/` – web UI code (to be created)
- `mobile/` – mobile app code (to be created)
- `docs/` – documentation (to be created)

## Next Steps
1. Set up virtual environment and basic “Hello World” backend.  
2. Scaffold frontend skeleton.  
3. Scaffold mobile skeleton.  
4. Configure Docker build files.  
5. Integrate API endpoints and UI.  
6. Add watermark/logo assets (once initial UI layouts exist).
